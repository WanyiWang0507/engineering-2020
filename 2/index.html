	<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; For this assignemnt, I created a simple Rube Goldberg device at home. This contraption was designed to open the box (toy cabinet) at the end of the chain reaction. There are three elements in it-- a inclined plane, a set of dominos and a lever. It was quite a journey before I reached to this final result. I started off experiemnting with some LEGO pieces and smaller objects, but they were very difficult to control due to their light weight. I then switched to a larger scale. I built up the inclined plane with a few paper boxes and adjusted the angle to make aure the toy car is going with a moderate speed. I then started to think about what I could use to set up the dominos. After a lot of trials and failures, my eyeshadow palettes were perfect (another excuse for buying same eyeshadows in different colors), and thankfully after this project the eyeshadows within did not break. I then turned to the final parr, a see-saw like lever to lift up the toy cabinet. As shown in the video, I spent some time adjusted the position of the pivot so enough force can be conducted by its arm. </p>

	<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Here's the video showing my experimenting process as well as the final result.</p>

    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; If I were to continue work on this project, I would definitely stablize every components of the contraption, because now they are roughly stuck to the floor by duck tapes. I would also like to add more components to make this chain reaction more complicated and fun. It would be ideal if I could create this part using specific materials such as cardboard and blocks instead of grabing something from my life, so I can keep my constraption to myself. </p>
